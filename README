The Benford Law Tester program is a program that I wrote in my early
days of programming, when I wanted to test Benford's Law. 
Benford's Law states that the pattern of numbers occuring is not
an even distribution, but is split with 1 appearing about 30% of the
time and 9 appearing about 5% of the time. I tested this by creating
text files with sets of data in them and counting the frequency of
each of the numbers.

I have since ported the program to the C programming language and 
applied some better programming practises to it. 

Some potential changes are:
    - Include more data sets
    - Made data sets generic
    - Make a better title printing system
    - Make a better pause system
