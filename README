The Benford Law Tester program is a program that I wrote in my early
days of programming, when I wanted to test Benford's Law. 
Benford's Law states that the pattern of numbers occuring is not
an even distribution, but is split with 1 appearing about 30% of the
time and 9 appearing about 5% of the time. I tested this by creating
text files with sets of data in them and counting the frequency of
each of the numbers.
I plan to port this program to a different language later on and apply
better programming practises to it. For example, comments need to be
moved to before code and system calls need to be removed.
